### Bonifatius (Boni) 🤯🚀💎 
Officially the coolest, smartest, most emotionally intelligent cat. Boni has been with us since 2022, when he and Dani came to Germany with their family who fled the war in Ukraine. The vets estimate that he was born in 2016--we don't know for sure, since his Ukrainian family had found him on the streets, gray and scraggly. Now he lives his best life chasing ribbons at the speed of light, raising his adoptive brother Rüdi, and showering us with more love than we will ever deserve.

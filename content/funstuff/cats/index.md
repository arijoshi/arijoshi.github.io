### Bonifatius (Boni) 🤯🚀💎 
 Boni has been with us since 2022, when he and Dani came to Germany with their family who fled the war in Ukraine. The vets estimate that he was born in 2016--we don't know for sure, since his Ukrainian family had found him on the streets, gray and scraggly. Now he lives his best life chasing ribbons at the speed of light, raising his adoptive brother Rüdi, and showering us with more love than we will ever deserve. 
 
 Boni is genuinely the coolest, smartest, most emotionally intelligent cat we have ever met. He is also an absolute charmer who is always down to socialise: he has collected a fanbase across the city consisting of everyone who has interacted with him. We like to say that he is a human trapped in a cat body because of how expressive he can be! 

(We did not come up with the sassy name!! His original family did that, and we thought it somehow fits...)

### Rüdiger Platon (Rüdi) 🥹🐥👑
His Majesty was born in 2018 and has been with us since mid-2024. His previous owner had given him up to the shelter, where he was looking for a home with a friendly companion. Around the same time, *we* went looking for a friendly companion for Boni, who was lonely after his original adoptive sibling, Dani, passed away. Rüdi has been through a lot with his health: not only had he gone (irrevocably) blind for unknown reasons about a year before we adopted him, and continued to have a range of GI issues to fight through. But we braved it together, and a year later, he is a fit, strong, and curious boy whose attention-seeking meows can be heard across the street. And although he is a LARGE cat, he is a little princess baby at heart who has the whole household, including Boni, at his service! 

Oh, and if you're wondering about his impressive appearance: it's because he is a purebred designer cat (a toyger). His long hair is a mutant accident, apparently. He came with his first name from his original owner---the second was our addition for sass, chosen because the shelter believed he could see shadows :3

### 🕊️ Dania (Dani) 🤗🥔🤍  
Dani came to us with Boni in 2022. We got to spend two years full of cuddles and purrs with him, until he succumbed to an aggressive renal cancer in 2024, at the age of 10. He lived his life following one primary goal: maximising the time that he can spend in direct physical contact with a human. Of course, we were very happy to oblige. He would sleep curled up inside my blanket; he would insert himself into every zoom meeting, not understanding why our hands were on a keyboard and not on his fur; and every time we walked through the door after being outside, he would throw himself onto the floor with a loud thud to present his belly for rubs. He was full of warmth and trust to the very end, accepting infusions and medicines with little fuss and being incredibly brave. We miss him a lot.
